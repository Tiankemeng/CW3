This essay considers one notable generative AI platform called ChatGPT made available to the public in 2022 for free use. ChatGPT allows users to enter text prompts and rapidly generates text responses drawn from its knowledge acquired via machine learning in engagement with the internet. This essay is coauthored by a human journalism and media professor in collaboration with ChatGPT. The essay demonstrates the capacity and limitations of ChatGPT and offers reflections on the implications of generative AI for journalism and media education.",

The first contact with the chatbot reveals its ability to provide detailed and precise answers in various areas. Several publications on ChatGPT evaluation test its effectiveness on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this work, we examined ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks, most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, offensiveness, and stance detection. In contrast, the other tasks require more objective reasoning like word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability, and question answering.",

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformerbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4\u2019s performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.",

An ever-growing body of research, however, illustrates the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples \u2014 inputs modified by introducing small perturbations to deliberately fool a target model into outputting incorrect results. The vulnerability to adversarial examples has become one of the main hurdles precluding neural network deployment into safetycritical environments. This paper discusses the contemporary usage of adversarial examples to foil DNNs and presents a comprehensive review of their use to improve the robustness of DNNs in NLP applications. In this paper, we summarize recent approaches for generating adversarial texts and propose a taxonomy to categorize them. We further review various types of defensive strategies against adversarial examples, explore their main challenges, and highlight some future research directions.",
